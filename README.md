# 🛒 DevOps Project – Automated CI/CD Pipeline for E-Commerce Platform (Jenkins, Docker & AWS)

## 🧩 Overview

This project simulates a real-world E-Commerce application deployment workflow, implementing a complete CI/CD pipeline that automates the journey of application code from
GitHub → Jenkins → Docker Hub → AWS EC2, with real-time deployment notifications via AWS SNS.

The pipeline is designed to address a common business challenge faced by online retail platforms — frequent feature updates, zero downtime, and rapid deployment cycles for new product listings, offers, and checkout improvements.
This system ensures every code change is automatically built, tested, containerized, deployed, and notified — just like modern e-commerce companies such as Flipkart or Amazon handle continuous delivery.

## 📌 Real-World Problem Statement

In a typical E-Commerce platform, development teams frequently push updates:
- New product catalogues
- Updated payment logic
- Promotional banners or offers
- Fixes for checkout or user authentication
- Manually deploying these updates to production causes:
- Downtime during releases
- Version mismatches between servers
- Higher risk of deployment failures

## 💡 Solution
This project builds an automated CI/CD pipeline that ensures every commit triggers:

-✅ Build and test of a Dockerized Node.js application
-✅ Push of the new image to Docker Hub
-✅ Automatic deployment to an AWS EC2 instance
-✅ Instant notifications of build success/failure via AWS SNS

With this setup, every new feature or bug fix pushed to GitHub can reach production servers within minutes, ensuring consistent and reliable user experience for the e-commerce platform.

## 🛠 Tools & Services

-Jenkins – CI/CD automation server (running on Windows host)
-Docker & Docker Hub – Containerization and image registry
-AWS EC2 – Hosting the production container
-AWS SNS – Real-time deployment notifications
-Git & GitHub – Source control and webhook trigger
-Node.js – Sample e-commerce app backend (order management mockup)

## 🚀 Implementation Workflow

### 1️⃣ Setup Jenkins & GitHub

-Installed Jenkins on a Windows host and configured required plugins.
-Created a GitHub repository to hold the Node.js e-commerce app and Jenkinsfile.

### 2️⃣ Configure AWS EC2

-Created an Ubuntu EC2 instance as the production environment.
-Configured inbound rules for SSH, HTTP/HTTPS, and app port 3000.
-Generated a .pem key pair for secure access by Jenkins.

### 3️⃣ Jenkins Pipeline Configuration

Key stages in Jenkinsfile:

-Checkout: Pull the latest code from GitHub
-Build Docker Image: docker build -t <image>:<build_number>
-Test: Run automated Node.js tests inside the container
-Push to DockerHub: Push the image for version tracking
-Deploy to EC2: Stop old container → pull & run latest image
-Notify via SNS: Send deployment success/failure message

### 4️⃣ Dockerization & Docker Hub Integration

-Used node:18-alpine for lightweight builds.
-Each commit triggers a new Docker image build with a unique tag.
-Jenkins pushes the image securely to Docker Hub.

Public Repository:

docker.io/deepakjaiswal09/ci-cd-with-jenkins-aws

### 5️⃣ Secure Credential Management

All sensitive credentials were securely stored in Jenkins:
-Docker Hub: Username + Access Token → docker-hub-creds
-EC2 SSH Key: Stored as ec2-ssh-key
-AWS Keys: aws-access-key-id and aws-secret-access-key

### 6️⃣ AWS SNS Notifications

-Created an SNS topic jenkins-notify
-Subscribed an email endpoint and confirmed subscription
-Jenkins publishes build and deployment results automatically
